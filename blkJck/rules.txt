Introduction

Blackjack

Game Objective

Blackjack is played against the casino so the main objective is to 
have a total hand value that exceeds the total hand value of the 
dealer without going over a total point value of 21.
A traditional 52 cards deck is used (or several decks) and each card has a 
point value attached to it. Aces count as 1 or 11, Face cards 
(King, Queen and Jack) count as 10 and all other cards keep the 
value that is printed on them.

How to Play

The dealer deals each player two cards facing up. The dealer 
also gets two cards but only one is facing up and the other 
is facing down (known as the hole card). Players are allowed 
to draw additional cards to the total hand value of 21.
Once a player drew a card that takes his total hand value above 
21 they bust out of the game. Either the dealer or player can win 
the hand with low valued hands in situations when one or the 
other busted out of the game.
